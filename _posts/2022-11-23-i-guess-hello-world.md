So this is it, huh? Hello, World!

Okay, so I have been wanting to create a blog for a loooong time. Not
because I think, I have a lot to say, but because I want to have a place
to speak my mind. Is there a better place to do than on the web? Maybe,
but I think this is a great place to start.

"So what can I expect?", I hear you asking. I'll probably blog about
what I come across that is interesting. Maybe even some interesting
engineering challenges, I've come across at work. I prefer doing
back-end work, so even though I think there's some really powerful,
interesting software on the front-end that's not where I will spend the
majority of my time.

This is my place on the internet so every now and then I may get
political --- I only expect this to be in side comments ---, 
but this is not a political forum. It will never be my main
focus, and I don't see that I'm capable of that either. If you are
interacting with others because of a post you read on my blog, please be
respectful to others!
