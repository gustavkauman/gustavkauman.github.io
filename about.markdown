Hi there! I'm working as Principal Software Engineer at a company
delivering [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/)
and a POS solution.

I have experience building systems with many different languages, 
platforms and architectures, but lately I've really been enjoying
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

I'm the type of guy --- and maybe you've already guessed it
based on the comment about Rust --- that likes to build things that work
the first time, and I would rather wait a week with shipping something 
to ensure that I don't create a months headache for me or somebody else 
in the future.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in IT and Economics from the [Technical
University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk). My final project was a full
stack application using React as front-end and Dynamics NAV as back-end
with Azure API Management as a proxy and API translator.
